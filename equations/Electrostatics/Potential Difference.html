    <h3>Electric Potential Difference and Electric Field</h3>
    <p>Equation:</p>
    $$V_f - V_i = -\int_i^f \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}$$
    <h4>Variables:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>\(V_f\)</b>: Final electric potential [V]</li>
        <li><b>\(V_i\)</b>: Initial electric potential [V]</li>
        <li><b>\(\vec{E}\)</b>: Electric field vector [N/C or V/m]</li>
        <li><b>\(d\vec{l}\)</b>: Differential path length vector [m]</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="equation-description">
        This equation relates the change in electric potential between two points to the line integral of the electric field along a path connecting them. It is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism, illustrating how potentials are influenced by electric fields.
