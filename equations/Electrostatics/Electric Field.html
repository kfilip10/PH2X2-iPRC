    <h3>Electric Field (\(\vec{E}\))</h3>
    <p>Equation:</p>
    $$\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r}$$
    <h4>Variables:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>\(\vec{E}\)</b>: Electric field vector [N/C]</li>
        <li><b>\(q\)</b>: Point charge [C]</li>
        <li><b>\(\epsilon_0\)</b>: Permittivity of free space [C²/(N·m²) or F/m]</li>
        <li><b>\(r\)</b>: Distance from the charge to the point of interest [m]</li>
        <li><b>\(\hat{r}\)</b>: Unit vector in the direction from the charge to the point of interest</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="equation-description">
        This equation describes the electric field generated by a point charge in space. The field strength decreases
        with the square of the distance from the charge and is directed radially outward from the charge.
