    <h3>Brewster's Angle (Î¸<sub>B</sub>)</h3>
    <p>Equation:</p>
    $$\theta_B = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)$$
    <h4>Variables:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>\(\theta_B\)</b>: Brewster's angle [degrees or radians]</li>
        <li><b>\(n_1\)</b>: Index of refraction of the first medium [unitless]</li>
        <li><b>\(n_2\)</b>: Index of refraction of the second medium [unitless]</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="equation-description">
        Brewster's angle occurs when light is incident on the boundary between two media and thereflected light is completely polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence. The angle is calculated based on the refractive indices of the two media.
