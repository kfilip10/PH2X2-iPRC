    <h3>Diffraction Grating Equation</h3>
    <p>Equation:</p>
    $$d \sin \theta = (m + \frac{1}{2}) \lambda$$
    <h4>Variables:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>\(d\)</b>: Distance between adjacent slits in the grating [m]</li>
        <li><b>\(\theta\)</b>: Angle of diffraction [radians]</li>
        <li><b>\(m\)</b>: Order of the maximum (m is an integer)</li>
        <li><b>\(\lambda\)</b>: Wavelength of light [m]</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="equation-description">
        This equation describes the condition for maxima in a diffraction pattern produced when light passes through a diffraction grating. The equation calculates the angles at which light of a particular wavelength is constructively interfered.
