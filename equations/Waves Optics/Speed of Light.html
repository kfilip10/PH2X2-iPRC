    <h3>Speed of Light in Vacuum</h3>
    <p>Equation:</p>
    $$c = \frac{E_0}{B_0}$$
    <h4>Variables:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>\(c\)</b>: Speed of light [m/s]</li>
        <li><b>\(E_0\)</b>: Electric field strength [V/m]</li>
        <li><b>\(B_0\)</b>: Magnetic field strength [T]</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="equation-description">
        This equation relates the speed of light in a vacuum to the magnitudes of the electric and magnetic fields. It
        demonstrates that the speed of light is derived from the ratio of the electric field to the magnetic field in
        an electromagnetic wave.
