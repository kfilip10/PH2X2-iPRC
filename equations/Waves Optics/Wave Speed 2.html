    <h3>Wave Speed</h3>
    <p>Equation:</p>
    $$v = \lambda f$$
    <h4>Variables:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>\(v\)</b>: Wave speed [m/s]</li>
        <li><b>\(\lambda\)</b>: Wavelength [m]</li>
        <li><b>\(f\)</b>: Frequency [Hz]</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="equation-description">
        This equation relates the speed of a wave to its wavelength and frequency. It is fundamental in the study of wave
        phenomena and applies to various types of waves including sound, light, and water waves.
