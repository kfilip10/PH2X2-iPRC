    <h3>Induced EMF in an Inductor</h3>
    <p>Equation:</p>
    $$\mathcal{E}_L = -L \frac{dI}{dt}$$
    <h4>Variables:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>\(\mathcal{E}_L\)</b>: Induced electromotive force (EMF) [V]</li>
        <li><b>\(L\)</b>: Inductance [H]</li>
        <li><b>\(\frac{dI}{dt}\)</b>: Rate of change of current [A/s]</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="equation-description">
        This equation describes the electromotive force induced in an inductor as a result of the rate of change of current through it. The negative sign indicates the direction of the induced EMF opposes the change in current, in accordance with Lenz's law.
