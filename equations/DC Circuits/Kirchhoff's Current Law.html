    <h3>Kirchhoff's Junction Rule</h3>
    <p>Equation:</p>
    $$\sum I_\text{in} = \sum I_\text{out}$$
    <h4>Variables:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>\(\sum I_\text{in}\)</b>: Total current entering the junction [A]</li>
        <li><b>\(\sum I_\text{out}\)</b>: Total current leaving the junction [A]</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="equation-description">
        This equation, known as Kirchhoff's Junction Rule, states that the total current entering a junction in an electrical circuit is equal to the total current leaving the junction. This principle is based on the conservation of electric charge.
