    <h3>Ohm's Law</h3>
    <p>Equation:</p>
    $$V = IR$$
    <h4>Variables:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>\(V\)</b>: Voltage [V]</li>
        <li><b>\(I\)</b>: Current [A]</li>
        <li><b>\(R\)</b>: Resistance [Î©]</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="equation-description">
        This equation describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit. It states that the voltage across a conductor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, with the constant of proportionality being the resistance.
