    <h3>Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)</h3>
    <p>Equation:</p>
    $$\sum V = 0$$
    <h4>Variables:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>\(\sum V\)</b>: The algebraic sum of all voltages in a closed loop or mesh [V]</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="equation-description">
        Kirchhoff's Voltage Law states that the sum of the electrical potential differences (voltages) around any 
        closed network is zero. This principle is used to analyze electrical circuits.
