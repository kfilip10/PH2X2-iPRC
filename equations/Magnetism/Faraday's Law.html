    <h3>Electromotive Force (EMF)</h3>
    <p>Equation:</p>
    $$\mathcal{E} = -N \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$$
    <h4>Variables:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>\(\mathcal{E}\)</b>: Electromotive force (EMF) [V]</li>
        <li><b>\(N\)</b>: Number of turns in the coil</li>
        <li><b>\(\Phi_B\)</b>: Magnetic flux [Wb]</li>
        <li><b>\(t\)</b>: Time [s]</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="equation-description">
        This equation represents Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which states that the electromotive force 
        induced in a circuit is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the circuit. The negative 
        sign indicates the direction of the induced EMF, as described by Lenz's Law.
